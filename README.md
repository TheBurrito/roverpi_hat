Derrick Bommarito <derrick.a.bommarito@gmail.com>

This project includes all of the software, hardware design, and documentation
used for the RoverPi HAT expansion for robot control.

The folders are organized as follows:

host - Code that runs on the Raspberry Pi for high level planning.
hat - Code for the MCU that handles I/O processing and motor control.
common - Declarations / functionality common to both host and hat.
docs - All reference manuals for parts used on the hat.
